## Installation

### Installation for Users

Currently there are no releases for Yer.  However if you have a GitHub
account, you can click `Actions` tab, choose a dev build and download the
executable for your operating system from `Artifacts` section below.  Once you
have unzipped the download there should be a single executable file, you
should be able to run it directly.  This is a temporary method to test the
application, there will be proper releases in the future.

### Developer Setup

1. Yer is built on [Bevy Game Engine](https://bevyengine.org/).  Please follow OS
